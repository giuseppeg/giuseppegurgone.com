Recently I added a feature to [Refined Twitter Lite](https://github.com/giuseppeg/refined-twitter-lite) to hide Like, Retweet and Reply counts.

Removing the popularity factor from Tweets has had a strange yet very positive impact on me: Twitter now feels way more quiet and the urge to reply to a debate or even expand a Tweet has dropped drastically.

As I run this experiment I am reminded of [_How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind_](https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3)  â€“ an article that explains how social media companies, among others, use a reward-based system (notifications) to get us addicted.

For this reason I think that I will add a new feature to [Refined Twitter Lite](https://github.com/giuseppeg/refined-twitter-lite) to hide the very notification badge - I will report back on this.

Is a life without Likes, Retweets and Replies ~~the~~ your future? Give it a try :)
