Recently my former co-worker Theresa tweet-asked about remote work and communication:

<div class="Copy-embedTweet">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wonder if work cultures shifting towards remote work will also cause shifts away from instant messaging towards longer form async communication that’s friendlier for collaborating across timezones</p>&mdash; t-ma shaped developer (@mapotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/mapotato/status/1263645517822562304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <!-- <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> -->
</div>

My reply to the tweet would be a bold _yes_!

Written and async communication are key in companies that are distributed across different timezones or that allow more flexible working hours.

In general keeping the relevant people in the loop (updated) and including them in the decision making process is quite important when working remotely.

Useful information must be available for others to consult at any time and it shouldn't be lost when people leave the company.

## A Practical Example

I have been working remotely for three+ years now and written and async communication have become the normality for me.

[PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) hires within ±6 hours of the UTC timezone so that there is always overlap and folks can discuss things on a videocall or pair if necessary. That said most of the work is done asynchronously and everybody does their best to communicate in written form with Basecamp projects, GitHub issues and Google Docs.

Important decisions are taken during a weekly team meeting or a [proposal](/proposal-driven-development) phase.

Slack is used for chatting, sharing the _start/end of the day message_ (written stand-up), ask detailed questions or for help.

<div class="Copy-embedTweet">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think PSPDFKit has figured out a good way to avoid daily stand-up meetings by using a start and end of the day message. <a href="https://t.co/pcIQc96Sxf">https://t.co/pcIQc96Sxf</a> <br><br>It is worth noting that we don&#39;t have weekly sprints and things like that but rather release/quarterly goals. <a href="https://t.co/cn7260V1F2">pic.twitter.com/cn7260V1F2</a></p>&mdash; Giuseppe (@giuseppegurgone) <a href="https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone/status/1221762218573869056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <!-- <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> -->

Inevitably some discussions start on Slack too, and that is fine!

Avoiding private conversations (DMs) and discussing matters in public channels (possibly using threads) is effectively enabling people to join the conversation later (async communication).

Normally topical or projects-specific channels help to reduce the noise and keep the discussion log fairly clean and easy to follow.

It it also important to recognize when it is time to stop discussing things on Slack and schedule a meeting or start a Google Docs to gather feedback.

## My KUDOS rule

You get my **KUDOS** for communicating well if you:

- **K**eep it simple but comprehensive
- **U**se a medium and vocabulary that is accessible to everybody regardless of their timezone, expertise and experience
- **D**on't take anything for granted
- **O**ver-communicate and talk with other teams
- **S**lack for sharing cat gifs (socializing).

Just kidding, Slack is a great place to start a conversation but eventually things need to be written down. Write a report.
