I would probably do nothing for a while

Nothing for me means living the analog life a bit more, connect more with the world and try to enjoy all the smaller things that I neglect because I sit in front of a screen for a good part of the day.

I would travel around [Sicily](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6iHA0DFeky/) to visit all the places I haven't been in my life.

I would also love to spend some time in eastern Europe. Everything there seems more authentic and fascinating, probably because wealth and capitalism haven't ruined everything yet.

Then I would probably like to teach a bit, do an internship as cook or [bake pizza](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hv8heD0Xe/) and maybe start some side project i.e. work on [my "baby"](https://readmo.app) whatever that'd be.
