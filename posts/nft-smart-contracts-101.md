NFT Smart Contracts are programs that run in a blockchain.

In this recorded live stream session I go through the basics of NFT Smart Contracts and contracts development as well as showing how to make sense of existing contracts using etherscan.io

Please [reach out](/contact) if you are a unconventional and creative NFT artist and want to collaborate.

## Invisible Mechanisms

As a bonus I explain the secret behind a very creative smart contract that was created for a Pak performance.

Pak's goal was to show their collectors and audience that the "Creation obeys its Creator" which means that the ownership of the [expensive] NFTs you bought should not be taken for granted.
