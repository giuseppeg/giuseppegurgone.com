The tweet below is spot-on

<div class="Copy-embedTweet">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the rush of sending a tweet is only topped by the relief of deleting it less than five minutes later</p>&mdash; bradley babendir (@therealbradbabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/therealbradbabs/status/1281309026052169729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <!-- <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> -->
</div>

I have tweeted and deleted plenty of useless content.

Often this is due to the fact that Twitter is not a realtime messaging app but I nonetheless want to engage with the people in it more and more casually.

Sometimes it is because I don't think before sending out a reply.

<div class="Copy-embedTweet">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love Twitter <a href="https://t.co/UsFGZihfbG">pic.twitter.com/UsFGZihfbG</a></p>&mdash; Giuseppe (@giuseppegurgone) <a href="https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone/status/1260164481054904321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <!-- <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> -->
</div>

Tweets instead are permanent short thoughts. Think of them as short blog posts.

## The Secret of Tweeting Wisely

Recently I started to practice better and less tweeting.

The secret sauce seems to be to compose a tweet or reply and then stop and think:

<blockquote>Will this be relevant and valuable in 5-10 minutes? How about 1 day? 1 week? 1 month?</blockquote>

If the answer is _Yes_ then I will press the button otherwise I will save to draft or discard.

To help myself with that I have also added a [delayTweet feature](https://github.com/giuseppeg/refined-twitter-lite/blob/master/FEATURES.md#delaytweet) to [Refined Twitter Lite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-twitter-lite/adhbafkkfbonbogdlaebnoegpoogngcc) that sends the tweet after a countdown and allows you to abort the operation before the time is over.
